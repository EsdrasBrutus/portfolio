# Esdras Brutus Portfolio

Hi there! I'm Esdras Brutus, a software engineer based in the East Coast. I'm a fan of the web, and I'm excited to be a part of the future of the web. This is my portfolio, where I'll be sharing my projects and learning about new technologies. I'm also a fan of the [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) language, and I'm always looking to learn more about it. Hope you enjoy my portfolio and if you like what you see, feel free to reach out to me! I'd love to hear from you!
